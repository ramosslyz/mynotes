# Attacking strategy

## ***Valid logins***
- See if the account have high privileges that can let you in to their internal network.
- Use the those valid creds to login into other services like [**Azure**](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3315102725201275&id=100001047404110) (assuming  they are running on an active directory ) ..etc

## ***Common Findings***:
- **Insufficient Authentication Controls [High]**
-- Misconfigured MFA
-- Not implementing MFA
- **Weak Password Policy [high]**
-- [Mitigation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/password-must-meet-complexity-requirements)

-  **Insufficient Patching [Medium ~ Critical]**
-- Outdated services or applications that may have a public exploit than can lead to a compromise.
-- For example an outdated **CMS **or **PHP** or a **Tomcat apache server** ..etc
- **Unexpected Perimeter Services [Meduim  ~ High]**
-- RDP , TELNET , REDIS, MEMCACHED ..etc
- **Default Credentials [Meduim ~ Critical]**
-- Mostly found when pentesting internally but this doesn't mean it's not present in the wild.
- **Undetected Malicious Activity [High]**
 -- Not detecting your malicious activity during the engagement.
 -- If they detected something , include that in the report. 
- **Insufficient Encryption [Low]**
-- Can be detected by **Nessus**
-- Risk --> ***MITM attack***
- **Information Disclosure [Low]**
-- From errors and HTTP response headers or login portals or breaking the search bar ..etc
- **Default web pages [Low]**
- **Insufficient Traffic Blocking [Low]**
-- Not blocking traffic from countries that they are not dealing with can make them a target for active hackers.
 
 - **Finding Credentials from a previous breach [Low - High]**
