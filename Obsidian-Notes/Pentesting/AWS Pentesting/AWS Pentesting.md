# AWS attack paths
- Scan the internet for public S3 buckets.
- Scan for common bucket names and finds a match.
- Scan for objects in the bucket.
-  Find matches and exfiltrates information.
# AWS Regions and Availability Zones
The storage of your data and the performance of the services depends on your region so make sure the closest region to you to minimize latency.You can look at the regions by selecting them in the top-right corner of the AWS console.

*The following screenshot was pulled directly from Amazon and
highlights all the regions and the local zones that you can select:*

### Availability Zones
Availability Zones are fantastic for minimizing redundancy and downtime if an EC2
Instance were to go offline. Availability Zones are created to allow you to distribute an
EC2 instance across multiple zones so that if your instance fails in one zone, it can still be
accessed in another.
This diagram illustrates how AWS utilizes
Availability Zones within each region:

# S3 Buckets
#### what is S3?
**S3 is a simple storage system** (as the name implies) and allows users to store data in the **cloud**. Just like how we store data on a file server, we can store data in what is known as an S3 bucket, which will hold the contents of our data. You can store copious amounts of data in these buckets and retrieve it any time you like.
#### How is information stored?
**S3** stores your data in what's called an **object**, also known as **object storage**. Object storage allows you to store data such as pictures, videos, files, and any data associated with them in the form of an object.
#### Using S3 buckets
S3 stores the following types of data:
- Pictures
- Videos
- Files
- Documents containing sensitive data,and so on

> **Important note** 
> *Remember, S3 is a local filesystem in the cloud*!

#### S3 attributes
- S3 bucket names are **unique and cannot be the same as someone else's**. These names are specific to a particular bucket within a certain area (vuln -> *Bucket Takeover*)
- You can create up to 100 buckets.
- Buckets are **assigned by region**. It's important to remember what regions you store your buckets in â€“ **that's how you access them.**
