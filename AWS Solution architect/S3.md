# Amazon S3 Overview - Buckets  
- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)  
- Buckets must have a globally unique name  
- Buckets are defined at the region level  
- Naming convention  
- No uppercase  
- No underscore  
- 3-63 characters long  
- Not an IP  
- Must start with lowercase letter or number
- Object values are the content of the body:  
- **Max Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)**  
- If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"


# S3 Encryption for Objects  
- **There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3**  
	- **SSE-S3**: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS  
		- Object is encrypted server side  
		- AES-256 encryption type  
		- Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256
	- **SSE-KMS**: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys  
		- KMS Advantages: user control + audit trail  
		- Object is encrypted server side  
		-  Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption": ”aws:kms"
	- **SSE-C**: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
		- Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key you provide  
		- HTTPS must be used  
		- Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made  
	- **Client Side Encryption**
		- Client library such as the Amazon S3 Encryption Client  
	- Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to S3  
	- Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3  
	- Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle
