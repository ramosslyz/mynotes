## Local file inclusion
**Methodology**
- If you found a parameter like this `/index.php?Example` try modify the parameter`Example` and look for errors that might indicate an LFI.
- Always test parameters for LFI or RFI and to exploit you can use [**PASTEBIN**](https://pastebin.com/)
#### Flag Places:
- phpinfo();
- User home directory
---
## Bypass upload filter
#### Methodology
-  Try uploading it from your localhost
```html
#Example Code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Click on the "Choose File" button to upload a file:</p>

<form action="WEBSITE" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" id="myFile" name="filename">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

</body>
</html>
```

#### Flag places
-  phpinfo();
-  User home directory.

## Command injection
- Try backticks --> \``
- If you are testing against a php webapp try it maybe the input is passed to dangerous functions.
- On contact forms send quotes as they may break eval or other dangerous functions if that are present.

## Sqlite injection
- **[[sqlite-injection.pdf]]**
- Always try all columns and try `where <COLUMN>="flag"` (if necessary.)
- ---
## Bypass 403
- Try changing method to PUT,POST,GET ..etc
- Add a referer header with the current path
- Add a referer header with the admin path
- Add cookies
- Add headers like x-Forwarded-for and x-origin with the current path or the admin path
- Mix and play with the previous points.

## Nginx
- Path traversal via misconfiguration in `alias`

## Wget
- If a webserver is uploading files via `wget` it's possible to bypass the filtering by uploading  a malicious code by injecting it in  a file with a very long name with two extensions.
- Then access the file by -> `PATH/\<FileName\>.php`
- Example
```bash
touch $(python -c 'print("A"*(236-4)+".php"+".gif")')
#This will produce
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.php.gif
```
---
### Git
```bash
#To view code
git reset <COMMIT>
git show
```
---
### PHP Functions
- Bypass strlen with exponential for examaple -> 9e9
- Bypass ' == ' with php type juggling.
- HTTP_USER_AGENT values are provided in User agent.
---
### Bypass WAF
- bypass capital letters by writting like -> hElLo
- bypass spaces by -> /**/
## Notes
- Always Dirbust and look for robots.txt and sitemap.xml
- Always test parameters for LFI or RFI and to exploit you can use [**PASTEBIN**](https://pastebin.com/)
