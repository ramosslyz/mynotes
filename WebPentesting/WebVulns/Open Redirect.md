Occur when a target visits a website and that website **sends their browser to a different URL**, potentially on a separate domain. Open redirects **exploit the trust of a given domain to lure targets to a malicious website**.
    

 An attacker can also use **JavaScript** to redirect users by modifying the window’s location property through the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is an API for HTML and XML documents that allows developers to modify the structure, style, and content of a web page.Because the location property denotes where a request should be redirected to, browsers will immediately interpret this JavaScript and redirect to the specified URL:
 ```js
 window.location = http://evil.com
 window.location.href = "http://evil.com"
 window.location.replace(http://evil.com)
 ```

# Example Payloads
### Using \<meta\> Tag:
  

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0 ; url=http://ATTACKER-SITE">
```
  
The content attribute defines how browsers make an HTTP request in two ways. First, the content attribute defines how long the browser waits before making the HTTP request to the URL; in this case, 0 seconds. Secondly, the content attribute specifies the URL parameter in the website the browser makes the GET request to.

## Providing a malicious domain:
  
`http://mystore.myshopify.com/account/login?checkout_url=.attacker.com  `
  
### They would have been redirected to the URL `http://mystore.myshopify`
     

 They would have been redirected to the URL**\<attacker>.com**, which isn’t a Shopify domain. Because the URL ends in .\<attacker>.com and DNS lookups use the right- most domain label, the redirect goes to the \<attacker>.com domain. So when `http://mystore.myshopify.com.<attacker>.com`
	is submitted for DNS lookup, it will match on \<attacker>.com, which Shopify doesn’t own, and not myshopify.com as Shopify would have intended. Although an attacker wouldn’t be able to freely send a target anywhere, they could send a user to another domain by adding special characters, such as a period, to the values they can manipulate.
	
## Takeaways
> If you can only control a portion of the final URL used by a site, adding special URL characters might change the meaning of the URL and redirect a user to another domain. Let’s say you can only control the checkout_url parameter value, and you also notice that the parameter is being combined with a hardcoded URL on the backend of the site, such as the store URL
> [http://mystore.myshopify.com/.](http://mystore.myshopify.com/.)
> Try adding special URL characters, like a period or the @ symbol, to test whether you can control the redirected location.
