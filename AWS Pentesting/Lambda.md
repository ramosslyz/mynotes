# Lambda
## When should I use Lambda?
Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service.

Lambda is an ideal compute service for many application scenarios, as long as you can run your application code using the Lambda [standard runtime environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-context.html) and within the resources that Lambda provides.

## Lambda features

The following key features help you develop Lambda applications that are scalable, secure, and easily extensible:

**Concurrency and scaling controls**

[**Concurrency and scaling controls**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-scaling.html) such as concurrency limits and provisioned concurrency give you fine-grained control over the scaling and responsiveness of your production applications.

**Functions defined as container images**

Use your preferred [**container image**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html) tooling, workflows, and dependencies to build, test, and deploy your Lambda functions.

**Code signing**

[**Code signing**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-codesigning.html) for Lambda provides trust and integrity controls that let you verify that only unaltered code that approved developers have published is deployed in your Lambda functions.

**Lambda extensions**

You can use [**Lambda extensions**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-extensions-api.html) to augment your Lambda functions. For example, use extensions to more easily integrate Lambda with your favorite tools for monitoring, observability, security, and governance.

**Function blueprints**

A function blueprint provides sample code that shows how to use Lambda with other AWS services or third-party applications. Blueprints include sample code and function configuration presets for Node.js and Python runtimes.

**Database access**

A [**database proxy**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-database.html) manages a pool of database connections and relays queries from a function. This enables a function to reach high concurrency levels without exhausting database connections.

**File systems access**

You can configure a function to mount an [**Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-filesystem.html) to a local directory. With Amazon EFS, your function code can access and modify shared resources safely and at high concurrency.
